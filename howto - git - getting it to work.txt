```Getting to GIT to work

```Background:
I want to get familiar with the shared workspace that is GIT
I can see the promise of it - it is like a global internet share ready non-gui cloud file system


```How I'm getting it to work
Git Desktop for OSX
Git Hub Account

```Configurations
+root - I created my git folder in the root at /gitfxlrd
++fxlrd being the local host

```Lessons Learned
+Commit before Push and or Publish
+The FOLDER is what is GITTING not the files
++A new file in the folder
